title: What Is Rationality?
elaboration: What is it to be or not be rational? Broadly speaking, it seems to be a standard for thought of some kind but colloquially these days it can be taken as vice as much as virtue. But what is it such that we take ourselves to understand what we are talking about when we talk about it?
position: A standard of comparison between beliefs and actions to logical structure

I've read a lot on the topic of rationality through the years but I want to get down my thoughts on rationality as such. More to come...
