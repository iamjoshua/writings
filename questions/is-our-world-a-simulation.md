question: Could we be living in a simulation?
elaboration: Could our “reality” be a simulation running on a great computer that exists within the actual reality of which we have no access to?

As far as I can tell, this is just a modern variation of classical skepticism. Famously in philosophy, there is no known defeater for skepticism. It seems to me that this is the case because it posits a scenario outside of the possibility of knowledge. Of those things which we can have no knowledge of in principle, what more can be done? However, I do think that this is a weaker form of skepticism because it might be self-refuting. 

A simulation is by the definition of the word a relation that holds between an object and a second object that mimics or endeavors to reproduce the first.  The first object might not exist but could be merely a possible object. This is usually cited as the reason for a simulation: to see what is possible as in the case of scientific models

with something actual. So in any possible world in which someone exists within a simulation, the simulated world must also exist. 

If all that we perceive is simulated, then it would seem that we still perceive something, namely, the simulation. But we wouldn’t need any knowledge of this fact to have perceptions. Perceptions would present to us how our environment is and our environment would be the way that the computer states are. So our perceptions would be of something and that something by hypothesis exists as states of a computer in a “higher” reality. What exactly would we be wrong about then? The beliefs that we are in the “highest” reality would be wrong of course, but that doesn’t seem to be an aspect of the content of most mental states. For example, I currently see a cat; the content of my current perception is that “I see a cat” and not that “I see a cat and the cat is an object in the highest level of reality”.

This questions presupposes that computers can create worlds that do not exist. But what does that even mean? It seems to me that a class of computers capable of “simulating” a whole world 






Luckily, despite current cultural interest in this question, nothing more needs to be said than what has already been said about skepticism.
