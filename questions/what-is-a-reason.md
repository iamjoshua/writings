question: What is a reason?
position: A proposition given to explain a belief or action.

I take facts to be true propositions made true by states of affairs—the way the world is, was, or will be. But a reason is more than a fact in that it is given socially or to oneself in thought to justify a belief or action. As a fact takes on this capacity it acquires a normative dimension. That makes reasons tricky to analyze. It also seems to be possible to cite false propositions as reasons which suggests that the analysis of reasons as facts could be incorrect. I think that both of these issues suggest that the term “reason” picks out something that is propositional but also functional such that it could be employed properly or improperly. 

### Reasons as propositions
It’s not clear to me how a reason could make anything intelligible if it didn’t represent something as being some way. A proposition is a workhorse concept in philosophy which picks out whatever sentences and representations mean, represent, or otherwise stand for. It’s a nice abstraction from any specific physical entity that expresses or captures meaning. 
### The objectivity of a reason

A proposition either does or does not entail a conclusion. This has nothing to do with one’s capacity for reason. So when I say that a reason explains a belief or action by making it intelligible I mean to say nothing about human cognitive capacities. But since a reason is a proposition selected to fill this logical role, it either does or does not do so successfully. It’s here where I believe that cognitive faculties endeavor to conform to logic, the standard which grounds the normative axis of a reason. 

So when a child is told “that is not a good reason” for why they did something, it means that the proposition given does not entail the proposition which picks out the action. It is “bad” in this relational sense. So while facts are not normative, this dimension of a reason is established by use. This is why I take that a reason is a fact cited to explain a belief or action. 
### Subjective reasons
