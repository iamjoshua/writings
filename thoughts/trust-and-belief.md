To believe is to accept that some information is true. Broadly speaking, when we trust someone, we believe that they are a sincere source of information and that they wouldn't try to deceive us. We can say that trust is an act of belief informed by past experience. But this belief is concerned with the intent of the source and not the specific information that they may provide. Understanding this subtle distinction between belief of intent and belief of specific information is important because it is possible, of course, to be sincere and yet wrong about what one believes. It is possible to be wrong about even the most "obvious" conclusion. A commonly accepted belief of one era is often a shameful misconception of the next. And so clearly sincerity doesn't guarantee truth. Trust can lend credence to an idea when there is a shortage of actual evidence and this is the danger we need to be aware of. Trust should replace or put off the pursuit of actual evidence for the ideas that we come to accept as trueâ€”our beliefs. When you blindly believe those that you trust you inherit their misconceptions.

It is possible to trust a source of information and yet not believe the information that they convey. It's also possible to believe information that comes from a non-trusted source. Whether or not we come to believe the information should come down to the evidence that informs the idea in the first place. Trust can be the impetus for investigation but it shouldn't be the evidence itself.  


What is true is a serious and difficult topic, but never one that should be conflated with trust which is a much easier subject to approach. When you blindly believe those that you trust you inherit their misconceptions.

Always remember that it is possible to trust and yet not believe or to believe what comes from where you do not trust.
