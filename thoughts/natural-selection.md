Both Fodor and Nagel along with years of trying to understand complex systems have convinced me that natural selection is not sufficient for explaining the complexity of life. Not that it is to be rejected for creationism or some other inadequate theory, but rather to be modified or extended to be sufficiently explanatory. 

I think it may not take much and whenever I think that it is sufficient as is, I then think about some simple principles that would make it clearly more explanatory of the universe as we know it. For example, is it truly enough to say that certain complex systems exist simply because they were possible and capable of continuing to exist? Couldn’t we say more about energy cost and stability in such a way that it better explains bursts of intentional-like development trajectories? In all types of systems, not just living ones, we see how certain paths make possible ever more complex variants that would not have as likely come about with by way of that particular lineage. This is what creationists often cite as reason for their view, and maybe they are right about the target of concern but wrong about their response. 

If it is the case that certain states make more possible certain other states then isn’t it clear that natural selection is insufficient at explaining the complexity of conscious life? Or how about a theory that works at the level of chemistry and also explains the diversity of life rather than a theory that takes hold once life is established? Shouldn’t the same theory that explains sustained chemical reactions explain the possibility of intelligent life before it exists to ask this question? Nothing about natural science predicts our existence.

Why does a fire tend to continue? A chemical reaction exists such that as long as there continues to be the satisfaction of its requirements of existence it continues. The fire becoming larger or hotter is made possible by it first coming to be. Incredibly hot fires which are so from their outset are probably incredibly rare, but incredibly hot fires which develop from typical fires are probably incredibly common. The realization of a possibility increases the possibility of others. This would mean that incredibly rare events, when they occur, would make other incredibly rare events become incredibly common even though they are even more rare than the instigating event. For example, perhaps life has originated only once on our planet. Trillions of life events happen every day here now across the wide spectrum of size and complexity of life forms, each fare more complex than whatever that initial event was. And yet, still, that more probable though extremely unlikely event has happened once while the ever more improbable human being, for example, occurs hundreds of thousands of times each day now.

But that the improbable made actual makes the more improbable actual isn’t exactly a helpful principle. 

Probability is an epistemic notion, so that shouldn’t be in the extra principle(s) anyways. Even complexity is suspect because it lacks a rigorous formulation.
