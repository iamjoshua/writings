The world is full of seemingly true stories. Even the most interesting and well-meaning pop-sci books contain narratives representing the synthesis of a field of study. We read these books and attain a feeling that we've been introduced to a new and accurate way of perceiving the world. But language is at best just a thin model of reality. It can't capture the complexity and uncertainty of life. 

Even if a particular event has happened ten times, nine of which were predicted based on the first instance, there is no way of knowing with certainty if the trend will hold beyond the last example. At the core of a narrative is an assumption of truth. But what can really be known to be true in all contexts? As data scientists say, "All models are wrong, but some are useful", I would say that all naratives are lies, but some are interesting.
