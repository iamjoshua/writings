When faced with a new concept one can agree, disagree, or reserve judgement until a fuller understanding is achieved. It's simply not possible to understand all aspects of a newly encountered idea right away without additional investigation. In these cases, the less you know, the more your current view of the world will inform your understanding of the new idea. So if you only understand 80% of a theory, but that 80% agrees with your current views, you'll tend to accept it completely and believe that you understand the idea completely. But by learning more you may encounter contradictions between this new idea and your current understanding of the world.

Contradictions are a major source of new information. Learning new concepts and resolving conflicts between them and your world view is the path to knowledge, but this conflict resolution process takes work and doesn't allow for instant acceptance or rejection. And so it might be true that there is a relationship between the ease in which an idea is accepted and the level of one's ignorance on the matter.

The unfortunate consequence here is that the more one believes they understand, the less motivated they are to investigate further. And so we can say that quick acceptance of an idea could be seen as a sign of ignorance as well as a mechanism to reinforce it.
