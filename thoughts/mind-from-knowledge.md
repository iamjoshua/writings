Learning feels like collecting. Watching game shows like Jeopardy can reinforce this intuition as we attempt to gather random facts. But this declarative type of knowledge is inconsequential when compared to the concepts and principles that we acquire and deeply understand. We say things like “that book really changed me” but retain a sense of a self-consistent “I” who possesses this new knowledge and perhaps don’t truly grasp that the self has been fundamentally modified. And yet it isn’t hard to think of experiences where new knowledge irreversibly changes one’s perception of reality.

I’ve begun to think about learning as a process of becoming. With each new concept that I learn, I don’t know more, but become more.
