It is a luxury of modernity that there is now more information available to us than there is time to gather it. Every act of information seeking represents a choice: You can learn *this* or you can learn *that*, but you can't learn both in this moment. And what you do with this moment will determine, or at least influence, what you do in the next. How then can we decide which information is worth seeking?

There seems to be a relationship between the number of possible actions a system like a human can take and the amount of information required to determine which of those actions is best. And since we are capable of lots of actions we seem to have an incredible thirst for information. However, I see many people in life full of opinions on matters that they have no ability to act on while they flounder on matters that they actually do. There is clearly a lack of prioritization at the very least. Information is anything that informs, but if there is no action to inform, is there any value to information? If I acquire traffic information about an accident ahead, I can avoid the loss of time by taking an alternate route. But if I acquire information about a celebrity drug problem, I can...essentially do nothing with that information.

But what about scientific endeavors where research promises no immediate results? History has shown that as we've expanded our understanding of reality we've improved our ability to survive within it. Even if any individual act of inquiry produces little, collectively the process has produced much. So it isn't simply a matter of justifying specific acts of information gathering, but of considering domains of information as well. The problem with the celebrity information is that it represents a domain of information which I personally have no ability to act upon. However, a person responsible for casting an upcoming movie, for example, may use the information that the tentatively cast star is in rehab once again, to inform the act of choosing a different actor instead.

We can't always know what information will be useful to us, but we can know what domains of information will or will not inform actions that we are capable of taking. As we continue to exist within this information rich time, I think this lesson is going to become more and more important to understand if we want to continue making progress as both individuals and a species.
