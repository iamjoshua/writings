It is a luxury of modernity that there is now more information available to us than there is time to seek. Every act of information seeking represents a narrowing of possibilities. You can learn *this* or you can *learn* that, but you can't learn both in this moment. And what you do with this moment will influence what you do or can do in the next. How then can we determine what information is worth seeking?

There seems to be a relationship between the number of possible actions a system like a human can take and the amount of information required to determine which of those actions is best. Without such possibilities, is there any need for information? Information is anything that informs, but if there is no action to inform, I'm not sure that there can be any value. If I acquire traffic information about an accident ahead, I can avoid the loss of time by taking an alternate route. If I acquire information about a celebrity drug problem, I can do...essentially nothing with that information.

But what about scientific endeavors where research promises no obvious immediate results? History has shown that as we've expanded our understanding of reality we've improved our ability to survive within it. Even if any individual act of inquiry produces little, collectively the process has produced much. So it isn't a matter of justifying specific acts of information gathering, but of valuing domains of information themselves. The problem with the celebrity information is that it represents a domain of information which I personally have no ability to act upon. However, a person responsible for casting an upcoming movie, for example, may use the information that the tentatively cast star is in rehab once again, to inform the act of choosing a different actor instead.

I just see so many people in life full of opinions on matters that they have no ability to act on while they flounder in areas that they actually do. As we continue to exist within this information rich time, I think this lesson is going to become more and more important to understand.
