Productivity, however bankrupt that term seems to be these days, might be seen as being at odds with stillness. And yet, conceptually, they aren't clearly oppositional. If one is overworked and unable to accomplish what one values, it's common to take time to rest. An of course we each sleep each night in order to support a waking life. There is no productivity without periods of stillness and so we can see that "productivity", in whichever specific sense one initially has in mind, has a dependence on something like "stillness". And less anyone thinks that this is simply an unfortunate limitation of our physiology, we could consider non-biological system's need for maintenance to reduce the buildup of entropy inherent to all physical systems. 

I recently had a flash of a memory of an interview that I first heard years ago with the philosopher Daniel Dennett on the now defunct 7th Avenue podcast. He made a claim that stood out to me at the time as odd—clearly odd enough to recall in relation to this topic when initially pondering—that agency isn't clearly a default mode for life. 

> Dennett quote HERE

I heard him say this before I had come to accept that life, whatever else it entails, might be grounded in single principle, let's call it the principle of life:

>Seek continuation; perdurance.

Essentially, any system which works towards conditions of continued existence as a cohesive causal system might be considered living. This might seem too broad, but I think on closer analysis one would see that it entails classic essentialist lists for life such as, for example, having a metabolism while also ruling out problematic systems like hurricanes which often slip into the category of life on these same lists as 'seeking' ultimately requires a notion beyond the mere causation, something breaks from immediacy which lets in all physical systems of a lesser kind. Something like "representation", which like a cell's membrane which divides a system from the world and enables the possibility of homeostasis, isolates a system's causal sensitivity from the immediate external causal structure. But I mention this topic here only as my cognitive context  while suddenly recalling Dennett's insight. If a living system currently exists within "good" conditions, of which a rough sketch of objective normativity could be those conditions which satisfy the principle of life, then stillness is a justified agential "activity".


The argument then goes: 

>If my being alive constitutively requires my seeking of continuation, and my current conditions do so, then stillness is justified. 

There are, however, other considerations. Consider sub-life systemic considerations like the conservation of energy. If a system requires more energy than is available, it will eventually cease operating. This would violate the principle of life, but a failure to operate would more simply fail to satisfy being even a simple system. Conserving energy relative to a system's environment is required to simply remain any kind of operating system. 

This suggests an even stronger argument than the one above. 

>If my being alive constitutively requires my seeking of continuation, and my current conditions do so, and if my being an operating system requires sufficient energy to continue operating, and my current conditions are sustainable, then stillness is a good strategy. 

There are, of course, many arguments from many disparate considerations for stillness. This simple analysis is an attempt to approach stillness foundationally. It's an attempt to make sense of different ways of life which, while seeming "lesser" than human from a classic scientific perspective, are nonetheless undeniably successful. Motivated by the human perspective, most religions and sage advice often promotes stillness in some form or another. There is something to stillness which from many perspectives feels "right" to most people eventually at some stage of their lives.
