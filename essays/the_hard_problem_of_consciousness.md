Outline: 
- it seems like it is like something be us
- the scientific world view doesn’t account for seemings
- if it is truly like something to be us then the scientific world view is wrong
- but every argument must start somewhere 
- But clearly science has largely been a successful process for generation true beliefs so it can’t be completely wrong. 
# On the Hard Problem of Consciousness
I believe that enough has been said about mind and world to successfully unravel the Hard Problem of Consciousness. There is no need for additional scientific discovery nor hard-nosed rejection of the problem. The solution is simple, though it does require some philosophical work to arrive at. I believe that “The Answer” is a method of detangling the matter that might leave both reductivists and realists satisfied. In a way, I am a deflationist about “The Problem”, but not in the typical sense. I take myself to be a phenomenal realist rather than anti-realist. Though, as you’ll see from what follows, I don’t think this is a meaningful distinction. 
### The Problem
To use Nagel’s famous and beautifully useful phrase, it is like something to be me and I take it that it is like something to be you. Why it should seem like anything at all to be conscious is the first aspect of The Problem. David Chalmer’s famously coined it as the Hard Problem of Consciousness. The second aspect of The Problem which Joseph Levine coined the Explanatory Gap picks out the apparent missing explanation between things which are conscious and all of the physical facts about those things. That is, if we know that system C is conscious as a matter of fact, and we have a complete physical description of C, we would be lacking an explanation for which facts about C make it true that it is conscious. Presumably C would know that it’s conscious because of the way that it seems like something for it to be. Since it wouldn’t seem like something for us to be it, because we aren’t it, we can’t rely on this experience to know that it is conscious. Classically in a less specified form this is known as the Problem of Other Minds. 

Oddly, despite consciousness now being an obvious problem to most modern thinkers, we find no reference to it until a few hundred years ago. This should be concerning as it would be quite hard to accept that humans gained self-awareness to the extent that we could question the nature of awareness for the first time just a countable number of generations ago. If we reject this idea, as we should given no independent reason to even entertain the idea, then we’ll need to look elsewhere for a correlation with the origin of the conception The Problem. The most notable option is the scientific revolution and the advent of the “scientific image”.
## The Scientific World View
Before modern times philosophers spoke of true and false beliefs; along with science arose the additional distinction between the objective and subjective. This distinction introduced a new kind, the subject, as different from the objective world. But this distinction wasn’t directly motivated by science, but an external desire to rescue an eternal soul from the “bleak” scientific world view. Most modern philosophers aren’t moved by the same desire, yet they still seek to resolve the tension between the scientific image and .... what exactly? 

The modern conception of consciousness still retains the essence of a soul in that it seeks to escape the bleakness of the scientific world view. Implicitly one wants one’s awareness to be “real” but additionally accepts that nothing like awareness is covered by the objective point of view. This is an essentially modern problem because the tension did not exist before the scientific revolution. This I think is the origin of The Problem. 

If it is like something to be us, truly like something, and we were essentially the same before the advent of science, then at least an aspect of the scientific world view is wrong. But if the modern world view is correct, then we’ve always been wrong about having awareness. If we’ve always been wrong, it wasn’t until science that we learned this. But what could it mean to be wrong about having awareness?

The ancient distinction between true and false beliefs is easy to understand, useful, and empirical. The very idea of empiricism after all is hard if not impossible to make sense of without this distinction. In a sense, empiricism just is the modern incarnation of the ancient notion of justification in that it provides reasons for accepting our beliefs to be true. Empiricism, however, has historically presupposed that knowledge is grounded in perception rather than the world. This seems to have moved early philosophers of science to conceive of science as the way by which to escape subjectivity and get a grip on the objective external world. But this view of the world and our place in it simply presupposes the distinction without argument. 

I think this provides a plausible origin of the explanatory gap, the second aspect of The Problem. With the observation of this gap between our experience and the objective facts of our physiology, the question of why it should be like anything at all to be conscious, the first aspect of The Problem, naturally arose. In this way, as far as I can tell, The Problem depends both logically and historically on the presupposed distinction between the objective and the subjective. Yet, I don’t believe that rejecting this distinction is enough to find The Answer.
## The epistemic problem
Nagel’s “What is it like to be a bat?” asks us to imagine, if we can, an answer to the eponymous question. If we could imagine something and it were true, then we would know what it’s like to be a bat. Nagel argues that we cannot do so. Yet, it will be like something **for** the bat, meaning, that to the bat as a subject it will seem like something to be the way that it is. This introduces a serious epistemic problem for subjective experience: if it is true that it is like something to be a subject and the subject can know what it’s like, but other creatures cannot obtain the same knowledge, then what is the nature of that knowledge?

It is hard to see why such knowledge is inaccessible in principle. It wouldn’t seem to be any known physical principle discovered by science. It gets worse, however, because it seems that in principle we can obtain objective information about the complete physical state of the brain of a subject without even needing to add additional facts about “what it is like”-ness. 

If it is true that a bat, and you, and I can know what it is like to be the way that we are for any given moment, then it must be the case that:

1. It is like something to be a subject.
2. We can form beliefs about what it is like.
3. These beliefs have content (are about something).
4. They are made true by something. 

This means that to know what it is like to be a subject at a given time, there must be at least two states:

State “Q”: Whatever it is, that is like
State “B”: The belief state that Q
### Inexistence  and reference
If we do not accept phenomenal realism, then Q does not exist. But if Q doesn’t exist, then either B is about a non-existent state or B also doesn’t exist as beliefs are individuated by their content. If the former, then I don’t know what kind of non-existent objects phenomenal beliefs pick out or even how they could pick them out—it can’t be causal reference and phenomenal beliefs seem to lack descriptive qualities essentially. If the latter, then no one has ever been in a B state. Instead we’ve only been in..
### Illusionism

state “IB”: False belief states with... illusory content? 

If Q states do not exist, and we don’t want to take a position on what inexistent objects could be such that they could be the content of belief then we need to also deny the existence of B states. Instead, we could have two additional states:

state “S”: A target like water to be taken to seem like something else
state “A”: Actual targets like a brain state, analogous to a mirage’s rising hot air
state “IB”: A false belief that A is (or is like) P

This is something like a very generous reading of illusionism as it allows for “seemings”. It only seems to one that it is currently like S to be oneself.  What is the nature of this “seeming” relation? If an IB state is simply the belief that one’s current brain states are similar to some state S, then perhaps they share some minimal though meaningful set of properties with S? That some properties might be shared is at least possible which would make some IB states actually true and with it illusionism false. 

Instead, perhaps “seemings” are predicative so that IB states are beliefs that S states are aspects of A states in the way that redness can be predicated of a red apple. This would guarantee that all IB states are false, as illusionism requires. But the problem with this is that it’s not clear which aspects of the world could serve as S states to be predicated of our A states. A famous characteristic of “what it is like”-ness is our inability to compare it to anything else in the world so on the surface this move isn’t well-motivated. 

The only viable option is that “seemings” are just identities. But, gain, what aspects of the worlds are being identified with brain states? What are the S states? This is the same problem that realism faces.

 It’s not enough to make claims of illusory beliefs to solve The Problem. Such claims must make sense of the “seeming” relation. And I’ve never seen an illusionist position that does so. Instead, “seeming” tends to be used as more of a Wittgensteinian ladder climb towards something else non-literal. The problem with this is that the philosophical destination is something like “just being wrong”. But if a belief is wrong, something makes it true that it is first a belief and secondly that it is false. This requires further position taking on the nature of representation, content, reference, and existence. 

And so it seems to me that anti-realism faces all of the same problems as realism along with the addition of the problem of the “seeming” relation. Simply accepting anti-realism as a consequence of the scientific world view isn’t an epistemically legitimate move if it has all of the same philosophical challenges as realism. 
### Behaviorism
With the above considerations, I don’t see how anti-realism doesn’t collapse into classic behaviorism. 

All physical states in virtue of being physical must make a causal difference in the world. If Q doesn’t exist but is still the content of B, B must have a causal profile in virtue of being a physical state. Since there are many Q-type states (what it is like to see red, feel pain, be a bat, etc.), the different B-type states ought to have different causal profiles. So an anti-realist could easily say that B states are just false beliefs that nonetheless make a difference and are in fact not individuated by “content” but by their causal roles/profiles/powers etc. This could be the case for all belief leaving “content” to be a confused notion or it could be the case only for false beliefs, or just the false beliefs about inexistent objects. But with this move, we aren’t just wrong about what it seems to us to be like the way we are, it doesn’t seem like anything to us. Rather, we just utter sentences and the meaning of those sentences are grounded in something else like convention of use. 

This could be the truth of The Problem. I think it is the best philosophical move when reasoning from the scientific image. But as with the problem of skepticism, we would never be able to prove it one way or the other within this world view. This certainly makes it a good philosophical move to make if one desires never be proven wrong. But if behaviorism is false, it’s a trap very difficult to escape from. 

## Denying the scientific image
The above sections were meant to motivate the key move of rejecting the scientific world view. It is this image of the world that introduced The Problem and by letting go of it we might find The Answer.

 It’s important for me to first emphasize that the scientific world view should have nothing to do with science. The scientific method, though notoriously hard to define, is and has been quite a successful way of acquiring knowledge. I don’t think that this should be in doubt. What should be in doubt, however, is the implicit world view that has developed along side of it. This world view, or at least those who hold it, made a silly equivocation error.
### The real and the objective
Let me call this the scientific world view equivocation (SIE):

What is real is objective; what is objective is measurable; what is measurable is accessible to science. Science is our way of getting at the objective.

This might sound fine at first, but 

The problem with SIE might be obvious. There is a circle between the objective and science such that the objective is what science delivers but  

#### Scientific realism
Does science get at the world as it **really** is? Or is it an approximation? Or is
