If I have knowledge of some kind that turns out to be wrong, modern philosophy claims that it was never knowledge but instead a false belief.

I have a problem with this.

There are beliefs that don't directly influence my behavior. For these, it is unlikely that I will come to find out that they are false, if for no other reason than I'm not gathering new information that could falsify them. My belief that capitalism is a better economic system than communism might be an example of this type of belief. It's possible that I could find ways to test this belief, but given my location in time and geography, the belief produces in me a feeling of contentment instead of curiosity to investigate. I don't have much to say about this type of belief here.

Some beliefs inform action and in doing so provide utility to the belief holder. If the result of the belief-informed action is the one desired, we could promote this belief to the level of knowledge. If, on the other hand, the result of the action is not the one desired, then the belief is false in relation to expectations. That seems straightforward to me and resonates well with the modern philosophical view of knowledge.

The problem, however, is that in complex systems such as our universe, there are infinite variables influencing the outcome of every scenario. A belief-based action might be validated by outcome ten times in a row before failing every subsequent attempt. Likewise, an immediately invalidated belief might have simply been unlucky the first go and would have been found upon further attempts to produce the desired result 99% of the time. The testing of any scientific theory accounts for this variability by leveraging statistics to minimize error produced my small sample sizes. But even with consideration for error rates and sample sizes, we can never be certain that a theory-based action which has never failed before will not fail at some point in the future. Most scientific theories, regardless of initial utility, eventually do fail for small reasons that require modification. With the modification in place, the testing resumes. For this reason, theories are never fully promoted to laws. Typically scientific laws are descriptions of reality while theories propose how or why these descriptions either came to be or how or why they will influence future states of the universe. In this way, a scientific theory is like a belief that informs action. No amount of testing will ever promote a belief to the level of knowledge, if, that is, knowledge is simply a belief attributed with truth. This line of reason supports the concept of radical skepticism which states that knowledge is impossible because absolute truth can never be attributed.

Intuitively (to me at least), this all sounds like nonsense. We account for probability in the most fundamental observations of reality, while on more practical matters we expect absolute classifications. It seems to me that radical skepticism is the natural result of depending on truth as an attribute to demarcate beliefs from knowledge. But while skepticism itself is a mental state that accounts for probabilities, radical skepticism assumes that nothing can be known and therefor if taken seriously should never produce an action. With regards to agency, this is not a policy that would lead to sustainability.

....


If instead of using truth as an attribute to demarcate a belief from knowledge we use the fitness of the belief-informed action, it seems to me that everything works better.

Knowledge would then be any belief that informs an action that benefits the agent. Even if any particular example fails, if on average the belief provides a survival advantage to the agent it can be called knowledge.

God is real is a belief. It is not knowledge, not because it is wrong, but because it doesn't inform action.
One should tithe 10% of earnings is a belief. Same response.
If you tithe, you will prosper. This is a false belief and therefore not knowledge, because studies consistently refute this assertion.
Religion seems to sustain people through extreme hardships. This is knowledge because observation will consistently support it even though it merges from belief.
I should be religious so that I can survive hardships. This is a belief that informs action. Since it will on average provide a benefit agents, it is knowledge.

But also knowledge by this definition won't always be true. Environmental changes through time will determine the utility of knowledge. What works today might not work tomorrow, but that doesn't change the observation of the utility today.

For as long as a belief produces utility it is knowledge. Once that utility drops below a threshold where it is more of a detriment than a benefit will knowledge be demoted to a false belief.

Belief: an unverified claim
False belief: a tested claim that never did or no longer does provide utility to an agent.
Knowledge: A currently verifiable belief


The subtle difference is consideration for time and variability. Truth is still attributable, but only relative to an agent at a given time. What ever the agent "knows" is what sustains it. While whatever it is wrong about, does not.

Conclusion:
Truth is a transient property
If knowledge is a true belief, then knowledge must also be transient.
