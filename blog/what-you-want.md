When I arrive at a scheduled day of indulging in the foods I don't typically allow myself to eat—the now ubiquitous cheat day—I more often than not find myself free of stored desire. Take my love of a well-made, or even poorly-made, pastry for example. I order the pastry; I sit down with the pastry; I hold the pastry; I bite the pastry; The pastry is tasty, but find this pleasure to pale in comparison to the intense unsatisfied desire of previous moments of restraint. No doubt I possess the capacity for intense pastry desire, but for whatever reason it does not seem active at this moment. This is quite the dilemma—now that I can have, I do not want. What can I learn from this observation?

I can't deny the obvious fact that the pleasure I am capable of experiencing can't be provided by the pastry itself. If pleasure was an intrinsic pastry quality, I would always experience it without fail. Enjoyment must be a state produced by my own mind in response to the pastry. This complicates matters immensely as the brain is a complex system with an infinite number of states. It is with one of these states, that we perceive our environments, which in this case for me includes a pastry. So I believe I can say without much reaching that enjoyment must be a possible experience that emerges from a specific type of state of the brain paired with a specific type of environment. 

I can make a few additional observations about this matter of desire. 
1. When I most want, I most enjoy. 
2. Some delay between initial desire and indulging can magnify desire. 
3. Though, desire does seem to have a ceiling. 
4. There seems to be a high correlation between level of desire and degree of enjoyment.
5. The desired action does not always lead to (complete) satiation.

From these observations it seems to be that the experience of pleasure depends on desire. That's not to say that there needs to be preexisting desire before introduction to a particular experience in order to produce enjoyment. The first bite can produce a desire for the second—or even just the continued chewing of the first. It's just that given the state of the brain and the introduction of qualities of a particular environment, the brain seems to latch on and encourage continued interaction with those qualities. Pleasure is our experience of that "encouragement." (Just why an objective state of the brain should produce such a subjective experience is a matter for a different essay, but it does seem that this matter of desire is the fundamental origin of preference that drives behavior and keeps us doing all of the things that humans and other animals do.) 

Enjoyment seems to be a state of the brain that  It should, therefore, be possible for the brain to produce a state of enjoyment without any environmental influence.


Cheat days are kind of a stupid idea then since you can't plan to desire at a future time (as far as I've experienced so far). Cheat meals would make more sense if maximizing enjoyment while limiting downside is the goal. Clearly more restraint than indulgence is still required for a healthy life of moderation, but allowing for a limited number of cheat meals (or any such activities) at peak levels of desire could increase one's overall sense of satisfaction with life. I can't know when I will want a pastry *the most* (I actually do want them all of the time so I kind of lied in the beginning to express a point...sorry-not-sorry), but I think having one pastry a week is perfectly acceptable. So instead of scheduling that one event, I can allow for the claiming of that experience at the optimum level at anytime throughout the week. It isn't the pastry that brings me pleasure, but my mind that grants it to me when it deems best.
