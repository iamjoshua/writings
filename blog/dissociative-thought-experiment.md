You wake up in a state of confusion, not knowing where or even who you are. After a few blinks of your eyes you begin to remember that this not your body and this is not your life.  The real you is someone and somewhere else. For a reason beyond your current recollection, your consciousness has been put in this other person. You don't know who you actually are but you also don't expect to know. After some more blinking and a good stretch, you become fully aware of who this person is—their memories are your memories and their thoughts are your thoughts. In all matters of being you truly are this person, and yet you also know that you are not *really* this person. 

You do remember one thing, however, and it's that you have one day to be this person. Each  day you wake up as a new person and that night when you go to sleep you expect to wake up as another person. Maybe you're some time traveling tourist from the future and this is the mechanism by which traveling is possible or maybe you're Scott Backula performing some kind of quantum leap of amnesia. You don't know and you can't know but what you do know is that this is the scenario that you believe to be true. You are this person in this time in this place with all of their memories, with all of their hopes and ambitions, and yet you aren't them and you know you aren't them and yet you don't know who you are or where you are or when you are. So the question is, what do you do today? Nothing that you do as this person will have consequences for you, the consequences will remain theirs and you're completely separated from them. It isn't that this person isn't real, or the day wont be real, it will be a very real day for a very real person with real consequences for them, but for you, you're free. You wish this person no harm—you don't wish to destroy their life—but at the same time there is really no accountability for your actions on this day.
