Why do we fail to reach many of our goals in life? There are myriad books that claim to answer this question, but I haven't yet come across one that reaches the fundamental problem (as I see it). 

That problem is what I think of as *mental entropy:*

> The probability of performing a future action is determined by the relationship between the number of possible mental states and the number of mental states with an active desire to perform the action.  

Or, put more simply:
> When your current state of mind resolves to take a future action, but you tend to produce more states of mind free of such resolve, you should expect that your future self **will not** take the action no matter how strong your current resolve is.

### What is entropy?
Entropy is a simple idea that starts to feel real complex real fast since its exact definition depends greatly on the field of science using it. The common—though slightly incorrect—example of entropy is in observing how a closet tends to be disorganized because there are more configurations of "messy" than organized. This example is slightly incorrect because it ignores what order actually is: it determines the ability of a system to do work. In thermodynamics, for example, the flow of energy from a usable (ordered) state to an unusable (unordered) state is defined by entropy. But instead of delving into the various nuances of entropy up front, let's move on to the mind and see how entropy can explain much about consciousness. 

### Entropy and mental states
If one believes in the idea of a constant self, then it would follow that whatever one decides in the moment, should hold true in the next. But even a small amount of sincere self-observation makes it difficult to hold such a belief. If you walk by a gym, for example, and see fit people on treadmills, you may suddenly find yourself in a moment of clarity from which you proclaim that, "this is the year that I'll finally get in my best shape!" Of course most of us have had a moment like this and yet few of us are actually at our best possible fitness levels. 

We tend to discount the important role that specific states of mind have in producing our desires. Because we have these desires, we identify with them and feel that they belong to us—or even are us. And so by having them we feel that we have changed in way that will remain through to future moments. Yet few moments of resolve truly do carry through to all future moments indefinitely. 

And because we own them, we expect to control them, but what observation can possibly confirm this perspective? Desires are fickle and we can't simply decide to have them but decide .
