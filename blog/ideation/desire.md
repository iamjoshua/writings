If pleasure doesn't cause desire, but desire that enables pleasure, what would the purpose of pleasure even be? An itch might illuminate the answer. Scratching a non-itchy spot of skin doesn't do much for me. But if that spot is itchy, it isn't quite accurate to say that I desire to scratch as much as I feel *compelled* to do so. I've often experimented with moments of itchiness and withheld scratching in order to observe just how intense that compulsion can be—it's maddening! So while I feel compelled to scratch, I still seem to have the agency to ignore the desire, retaining some sense of free will. Pleasure might then be the state that the mind looks forward to experiencing. If enjoyment wasn't a potential state of the brain, it couldn't be anticipated. But this makes it sound like desire is simply the anticipation of pleasure, which is more aligned with my default intuitions than this new perspective so far. Unless...what if compulsion is just what we call neurological activity in older regions of the brain that evolved to simply program organisms to act unconsciously? Desire could be the result of much newer neurological regions—perhaps the conscious experience of lower level compulsion? It could be the conscious brain that looks to understand the compulsion by way of expectation of pleasure—what we experience as desire.
