When I am hungry, I want to eat. But if I then look in a mirror and notice that I've been eating more than I should lately, I might decide to resist the desire to eat. In this conflicted state of mind I seem go from a me to a we. There is the me that wants and another me that does not want to want. Which me am I? It's not clear to me (more on this me in a moment) because these two "mes" appear to exist at different levels of awareness—the first is aware of the desire, whereas the second is aware of the desire, the long term consequences, and the additional desire to not realize these consequences—and never converge but remain distinct perspectives in a zero-sum game. But now, come to think about it, who is the me that is observing these other mes? This additional me now brings the total instances of me up to three.

It would be easy to say that these mes are just thoughts and that I am that one true me observing these thoughts. But do I want to eat? Yes, I would like that very much. But would I also like to avoid the extra calories? Yes, I would like that very much. Well, then I don't seem to be a me having those thoughts, but different mes identifying with those thoughts. There is certainly a common thread of identity between these mes—each feels in agreement with their specific views including the top observing me which seems to agree with both lower observed mes as well. So perhaps there aren't really many mes but a single me considering and identifying with a different breadth and depth of information at a time perhaps like an author writing dialogue for and losing herself in her characters during a single writing session. This seems plausible since I can only be one me at any specific instance of time.

But if I follow this logic through to the sweet beginning, there wouldn't even be a need for a single me at all, but simply an act of identification with the totality of information that is active in the mind in a given moment. I would be whatever I am thinking about. I would not be the thinker of thoughts, but the result of thoughts thought. This feels strange and unfamiliar to me but also somehow intuitive and informative when I think about different examples of cognition. Take for example the prized state of flow where one loses oneself in a task. A complete lack of self-awareness is a critical feature of this state of mind—there is only the task and a great sense of contentment. Where do we go when we are in flow? Perhaps the thinker only emerges when the contents of thought are of the origin of thought itself—like looking at the window instead of through the window. When I look at a cloud in the sky, then I am that cloud. When I look at a different cloud, then I become that cloud instead. If I look at the complete sky, then I see all of the clouds and become the sky itself. And if I look at the window, I become the window through which all of the sky is visible. But all of this cloud talk is for the birds because it's an analogy that assumes there is an observer which is the very thing that I'm trying to understand in the first place. Sorry.

But on further thought, if I show you a picture of a window you would have at least two possible perspectives. One could be that you yourself are looking through the window in the picture. A second could be that you are seeing someone else's perspective as they look through the window in the picture. Neither perspective is "correct" in absolute terms since it really is a matter of both literal and figurative perspectives. It is the mind that attributes whichever perspective it is most accustomed with. And maybe that is the linchpin to this whole idea. If we assume that a self is a concept of perspective then it can be identified with just like any other thought. If in a current moment the contents of my mind includes food, I could say that I am food-aware, and likewise if the contents include this concept of self-perspective, I could say that I am self-aware. Now with this view the analogy of the window doesn't seem to break down since the implied observer is just the concept of perspective itself.

I find this theory of self interesting, but there are practical implications that seem to suggest that it could also be true. All of the oddities of human nature exposed by behavioral economics and various strange mental health conditions like dissociative identify disorder or schizophrenic hallucinations, for examples, would not just be explained but expected. Any decision I make wouldn't be made by "me," the person living a life and with a head full of knowledge, but by the active information in the mind at that moment. From moment to moment I could make contradictory decisions while when sporadically prompted report a consistent narrative of my obviously false motivations. When acting, one set of information would be active in the mind, and when reporting, another set of information which includes the concept of self with all of its attributes would be active. One person with many disparate states of active information, each identifying with a particular perspective of information in a moment of time. To be the same self from one moment to the next would require having the exact same information active in the mind in both but with each new experience and thought these contents change. And since each moment harbors a different self, there is no one self to observe the subtle moment-to-moment contradictions that would destroy the whole illusion of a constant self.

When you consider dissociative identity disorder, you are faced with an illness that is incredibly hard to explain while preserving any hope of a constant self. Individuals with this condition jump between identities without control. Each identity tends to conveniently specialize in some aspect of the person's life in an extremely compartmentalized fashion. Even the person's memories seem demarcated by these identities. I've often read that this is thought to be a natural post-traumatic stress defense of the mind, but while that may be true it doesn't actually explain the root cause of the condition. The theory that I've outlined above accounts for this state of existence since the self is just an identifiable (or attributable) concept. In theory, a person could hold concepts of many selves. I was raised, for example, to believe in the Holy Spirt (I no longer believe in spirits, holy or otherwise) and sincerely thought that when I had an insightful thought that it was this person becoming me or communing with me. So I'm quite familiar with the experience of being different mes.   

That all seems pretty straightforward, right? There is a lot more to explain here, but for now I just wanted to present the basic idea. I can't imagine anyone would find all of that confusing in any way...

Part II coming soon or not soon or never.
