If I am hungry, I want to eat. But maybe I observe (in the mirror) that I tend to eat more food than I need, and decide not to eat. I then both want to eat and to not want to eat. Or perhaps more accurately, I wish to not be hungry, so that I no longer feel compelled to eat. In this state of mind "I" become "We." There is the me that wants and another me that does not want. The first wants to take an action and feel the sensation of eating and the second doesn't want to see itself take up more of the mirror. The first is a direct desire and the second is indirect. These two "mes" exist at different levels—the first aware of the action and the second aware of the action as well as a reason to not take the action.

But then who is the "me" that is observing these other two? We now seem to be three. But are there really many mes or a single me considering different information? After all, it seems that I can think as each me within a session of contemplation, but can only be one of the mes in any specific given instance of time. So maybe there aren't really multiple mes, but a single me considering different depths of information. Well then for that matter, maybe there isn't really even a single me at all, but simply the information that is active in my mind itself. In this case I am not the thinker of thoughts, but the result of the thoughts. Perhaps the thinker only emerges when the contents of thought is of the thoughts themselves.

We can see the horizon where the ground meets the sky and no matter what the specific terrain or the color or shape of the clouds in the sky, they are still demarcated in the mind as the ground and the sky. Likewise, no matter the contents of the mind, perhaps the sense of self is just how the mind demarcates itself from the things that it thinks about—there are the thoughts and the observation of the totality of thoughts. As the contents change, the distinction would stay the same. Different clouds, same sky. This would mean that the self is just whatever is currently active in one's mind. The vessel takes the shape of the contents, but is still called the vessel.

I find this theory of self interesting for pure philosophical reasons, but there are practical implications that seem to suggest strongly that it could be true. All of the oddities of human nature exposed by behavioral economics, for example, would not just be explained but expected. Any decision wouldn't be made by "me," the person living a life and with a head full of knowledge, but by the active information in the mind at the moment of action. From moment to moment I could make contradictory decisions while all along reporting a consistent narrative of my motivations, because when reporting, the contents of my mind would be that information. A consistent self shouldn't be assumed, but sought. To be the same person from one moment to the next is to have the same information active in the mind from one moment to the next.

Why do most people fail at dieting? Well, we spend far more time in front of food than in front of mirrors, and so we should expect to be selves aware of food more often than selves aware of itself in the mirror after food. These aren't two different selves competing as traditional behavioral change perspectives suggest, but the result of the frequency of turn taking. Each in turn acting as the self, aware of the others when in moments of reflection, but with different perceptions and goals. And so you can remember resolving to avoid donuts while you look down at the donut in your hand with the fresh bite mark. Psychology comes up with complicated explanations for this common contradiction, but to me it feels quite simple: I am just not that exact same person from moment to moment and so there is no, and can be no, conflict. Any perceived conflict is just yet another self emerged from the awareness of the thoughts of previous selves. I can remember resolving not to eat the donut, later eating the donut anyways, while being impartial in the most current moment without any strong opinion on either of these selves simply because I'm neither hungry nor feeling guilty. Or how about when we remember a past event and feel embarrassed about how we acted even though at the time there was no such feeling. Clearly in the current self there is additional information that wasn't present at the time of the remembered event. And so we can remember being a different self, while believing we are the same self. This is the contradiction—the assumption of a constant self.

If we wish to change, we mustn't think of things like will power or behavioral conditioning, but of information and mental contents. If we wish to act in a certain way, we must not expect to follow through anymore than a father should expect their son to follow the family trade. The son will encounter different information and become a different person and the father's plans will seem irrelevant. So we must first expect that the future will belong to a different self and second discover what information created this resolve for this self and third figure out how to make that information available to the next self. In this way, we can increase the odds of the next self feeling the same way as the current self. Recreation of past selves is the key to consistent behavior.
