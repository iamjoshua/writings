Most of us fail to reach our goals in life. Ignorance of the true nature of self just might be a primary factor to this chronic problem. Meaningful goals require a degree of constancy in behavior. If you decide to walk across the room in one moment but then decide to sit down in the next moment you wouldn't achieve the first moment's goal. Each me now inherits the thoughts and decisions of me past with an implicit acceptance that past mes were also me. And so I continue the lineage of mes coming to identify with the thoughts that I am now. This moment-by-moment reification seems to be the origin of the concept of self, but a very important process for the accomplishment of time-spanning goals. But this process breaks down when a future me is composed of new contradictory information, like say, while walking and my phone rings and I look down at it for a moment. I may lose my—past—self in that moment, then, once done with the phone, look back up and wonder what I was doing before. A bit of searching may recall the missing information and recompose a version of that past self important to the past goal. Those odd moments are great insights into the true nature of self.

What I'm interested in exploring here is how I (or me or we or us) might use this burgeoning theory of Active Information Identity Theory of self to become a version of me that me has always wanted to be.

Just dive in here. This is for me. How can I improve? I want to get back in amazing shape and keep it this time. Don't generalize it, focus on me for me and it will be interesting to explore.



In this moment now I can think about this body and life that I find myselves in and can compare this me now to other possible versions of me. I could be more like this or like that or doing this or doing that or being there or staying here etc. And typically along with these comparisons comes judgments or preferences or value attributions that place one scenario above another. I am happy that I am person who craves learning and that I'm not addicted to heroin, but I also wish that I was taller and better at making myself go to bed earlier each night.
